# Different data types

product_id = 123 # int. You do'nt need to declare it, the interpreter will do that automatically.

sale_price = 14.99 # float. There is a decimal library. Floats are not so precise and stable.

tip_percentage = 1/5 # fraction. If run, python will reeturn 0.2 automatically.

# Calculations are done dynamically
new_product = 150
print(sale_price + new_product) # this will return 164.99, mixing the int with the float and returning a float.
