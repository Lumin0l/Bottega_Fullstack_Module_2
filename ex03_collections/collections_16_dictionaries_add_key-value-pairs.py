# How to add stuff to dictionaries:
teams = {
  "astros": ["Altuve", "Correa", "Bregman"],
  "angels": ["Trout", "Pujols"],
  "yankees": ["Judge", "Stanton"],
}

# Just type it bro
teams['red sox'] = ['Price', 'Betts'] # as seen, as long as they are passed as strings, keys can be as long as it's needed.

print(teams)
