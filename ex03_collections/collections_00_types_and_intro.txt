In other languages there is stuff that works like arrays, but in python there is more.

There is:
Lists: very much like an array.

Dictionaries: not so much, more akin to a struct. It has 'keys' that stores values. More like a double array where the first holds the key to see what's stored in the second.

Tuple: very similar to the list, or the array. It has a couple of differences that we'll work on later.
